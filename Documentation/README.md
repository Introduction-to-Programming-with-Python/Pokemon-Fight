# Pokemon Fight

This project aims to apply some programming foundations concepts and Python functionalities applied to a pokemon fight game which based on some pokemon data answer to some program options.

## Respository structure

- The folder [Code](/Code/) contains the code.
- The folder [Documentation](/Documentation/) contains the repository documentation files and context about this project.
- The folder [Data](/Data/) contains the data soruces for this project.

## Statement

This [document](/Documentation/statement.pdf) contains the context of the problem, requirments and functionality for each file and function.

## Objectives

This project aims to apply the following functionalities:

- Read CSV files in Python
- Make partial and total tours of lists and dictionaries
- Use dictionaries of dictionaries

## How does it work?

The file [pokemon_consola.py](/Code/pokemon_consola.py) has one function for each requirment executing the neccesary functions from the file [pokemon_funciones_solucion.py](/Code/pokemon_funciones_solucion.py) that help to solve the requirments.

## Execution

To execute the program you have to execute the [pokemon_consola.py](/Code/pokemon_consola.py) file.

Once you execute the [pokemon_consola.py](/Code/pokemon_consola.py) file, a list of options will be deployed and ready for you to navegate across the program.

You can find execution examples in [this folder](/Documentation/Examples/)
